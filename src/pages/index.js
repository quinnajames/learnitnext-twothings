<h2>Learn to use advanced Git</h2>
<p>Many developers these days already know how to initialize a Git repository, push commits to it, and pull a copy of their code.
 But do you know how to fix a merge conflict? What do you do when something goes wrong? In a job situation, you’re likely to deal
  with some of the thornier aspects of Git. Employers will appreciate if you understand features like stash and bisect, covered
  in <a href="https://www.toptal.com/git/the-advanced-git-guide">The Advanced Git Guide</a>  and the advanced mode
  of <a href="https://wildlyinaccurate.com/a-hackers-guide-to-git/#references">A Hacker's Guide to Git.</a> But 
  the ultimate reference is <a href="https://git-scm.com/documentation">Git’s official material.</a></p>


<h2>Learn how to do Unit Testing</h2>
<p>Most modern web app development teams won’t want let you submit code unless it’s tested – and doesn’t break the team’s existing test! 
Learn how to use a testing framework like <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a>  and a test runner
like <a href="https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html">Karma</a>. 
A tutorial that uses both together is <a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/testing-angularjs-with-jasmine-and-karma-part-1">here.</a> But
don't just learn in the abstract: use it in your portfolio! That way you’ll really learn – and appreciate the benefits!</p>
